Instacart Efficiency Project

Ultimate Goal:
-Figure out which are the best days to be a shopper.

Null Hypothesis:
-Every day is the same, efficiency-wise.

Hand Recorded Variables:
-date = Date (mm/dd/yy)
-d_o_w = Day of the week
-time_start = Start of the work day (going online)
-time_end = End of the work day (going offline)
-total_time = Amount of time spent working
-mileage = Miles driven that session (XX.X)
-earned = Money earned (XX.XX)
-total_batches = How many batches were completed
-cash_tips = Cash obtained from customers upon delivery

Added Variables:
- total_time_hrs = Total time in hours (X.XX)

- total_time_min = Total time in minutes

- eff = Efficiency = (Earned / (Time spent + Cost per mile * Mileage))
	-Todayâ€™s AAA National Average $3.676 Price as of 4/18/23
	-Vehicle averages 29 MPG.
	-Cost per mile =  0.1267 ($0.13)

-d_o_wR = Day of the week represented numerically
	-Monday = 1
	-Tuesday = 2
	-Wednesday = 3
	-Thursday = 4
	-Friday = 5
	-Saturday = 6
	-Sunday = 7


Analyses:
- Correlation Matrix = No shocking relationships.

- Days of the week worked = Ensuring that each day had a similar amount of data recorded.

- Daily Efficiency Averages:
	- Sun    6.173628
	- Tue    6.107056
	- Mon    5.751901
	- Sat    5.732059
	- Fri    5.016584
	- Thu    4.892312
	- Wed    3.982727

Dashboard Graphs:
- Distribution of:
	- Days of the week worked
	- Avg earned per day
	- Avg efficiency per day
	- Avg mileage per day
	- Avg number of batches per day
	- Avg time worked per day

- Efficiency over time = The unlocking of different tiers is clearly seen to give access to better batches over time.  Instacart doesn't retain the information as to when you move into the different tiers and I didn't think to record it as it happened.
	- No tier
	- Gold Tier
	- Platinum Tier
	- Diamond Tier
